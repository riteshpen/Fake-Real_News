# Fake-Real_News

## Information
In this end-to-end NLP project, I could classify whether a news article's headline was real or fake 
across various topics (e.g., politics, health). Using the dataset provided to me by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification), 
I was able to detect fake news. I first preprocessed the text by applying sentence segmentation, word tokenization, and lemmatization, and then I used feature engineering
to convert the preprocessed text into vector format. I then trained using a Gradient Boosting Classifier after applying scaling. I saved the models used for scaling and classifying where I could make the prediction. I used Streamlit to create a website and deploy it on the cloud.
